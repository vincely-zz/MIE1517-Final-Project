# **Problem Statement & Goal Descriptions**
To solve the lack of efficient-automated cats breeds identifying systems, we create such a model. Our model can highly reduce the cost of time and increase the accuracy of identify cats breeds compared to the traditional method of manually identifying.

Our model is vital to people like animal shelters employees and researchers. Animal shelters can improve the adoption rates by providing accurate breed information. Researchers can benefit from our system when doing genetic studies.

We have great interest in this because it easily lets people know about cat breeds through images or videos.

The following code shows our walkthrough of from data loading to implementation and prediction step-by-step.

  - Include all cat breeds we used in our project. **Note: We mannually filtered the images, for example by removing duplicate images or deleting irrelevant images.**
* Testing Data - Include new data/images which tested on our final model for performance
